I've added some Systemd.Timers to this site which I was hoping would automatically update the main page calendar to not still say "December" when we're already in April.
But it seems hugo is "smart and kind" and won't update things if the content is unchanged...? So this is a bit of a test post. And a status update I guess? I'm now theorizing if I will have to just update the "last modified" field on a file to make hugo update the site? Regardless if there's no content change?
